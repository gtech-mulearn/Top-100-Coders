### birthdayCakeCandles 


  - [Solution](./solution.py)
  ### - Explanation: 
        The function birthdayCakeCandles takes a list of integers called candles as input, representing the heights of candles.
        It initializes two variables: max_height to keep track of the maximum height and count to store the count of candles with 
        the maximum height. Both are initially set to 0.
        The max function is used to find the maximum height among all the candles in the candles list. 
        This is done by iterating through the list and updating max_height if a taller candle is found.
        After finding the maximum height, the function uses the count method on the candles list to count how many times the maximum 
        height appears in the list. This count represents the number of candles with the tallest height.
        Finally, the count is returned as the result of the function.
        For example, let's say the input list candles is [4, 4, 1, 3, 2, 4]. The function will identify 
        that the tallest candles have a height of 4 and count how many times 4 appears in the list, which is 3. 
        Therefore, the function will return 3 as the output.
