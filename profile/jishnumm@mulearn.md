# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

### About Me

Proficient in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `Python`, `PHP`, and a range of frameworks including `Tailwind CSS`, `Express`, and `React`, I craft innovative web applications from concept to deployment.

My expertise extends across the realms of development and design, delivering captivating user experiences and compelling visuals.


#### My Contribution:
My name is Jishnu M M, an ardent developer of Team Reverend. Eventhough, I am a beginner in fullstack development, and an intermediate python developer, I tried to make one of the most useful tools that can be used as a Visual Studio Code extension.
- OpenAI Audio Transcription Integration - The core objective of this extension is to seamlessly integrate OpenAI's powerful audio transcription capabilities into Visual Studio Code, enabling users to transcribe spoken words into text effortlessly. The goal is to break down barriers in communication by allowing developers to interact with their codebase through voice commands, enhancing accessibility and fostering a more dynamic coding experience.
- The central objective of this extension is to revolutionize file management within Visual Studio Code by providing users with a prompt-friendly interface. The goal is to simplify and expedite common file-related tasks, enabling users to create, edit, and organize files through natural language prompts. This approach aims to enhance the overall coding experience by reducing manual effort and making file management more accessible.

#### Key Contributions:
- Implemented file management within Visual Studio Code providing users with a prompt-friendly interface.
- OpenAI's powerful audio transcription capabilities into Visual Studio Code extension.

#### Challenges Overcome
- Getting voice input in typescript node.js environment was really tough and is really hard to implement. So I tried to do it it in webview but since all other features which we made was needed to be merged into one it will take some time. Thats why I implemented it without webview. And if I get the opportunity to pitch it to the judges on the final day, I will try to implement the real time voice recognition using webview feature.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Looking ahead, I plan to implement realtime voice speech to text in visual code extension.
- Also, I want to make the whole extension in webview and with a sidebar facility.
- Extra extensions installation using our extension that can be used for various projects.
- When getting error in terminal and our extension reads that error and apply the solution on its own.
  
#### Final Thoughts:
- For a beginner who doesn't know how to run linux commands, do git commands, and read documentation and copy package installation codes, our extension is a boon to them.
