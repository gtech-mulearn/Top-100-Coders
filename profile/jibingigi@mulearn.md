### About Me

> I am currently pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and Engineering with a passion for self-learning. I consider myself an intermediate coder, proficient in C and Java, and nearly intermediate in Python. I tend to avoid small, time-consuming tasks and prefer to develop solutions that complete them in fewer steps, even if the tasks are larger. I interned at GTech Mulearn as a Campus Intern for six months, where I gained valuable industry insights and learned about evolving recruitment processes, which shifted my perspective significantly. During my internship, I participated in events like Permute, In50hrs, and DPI, which expanded my network and allowed me to connect with professionals from various fields. I also have experience in design using Figma, and I am currently working as the Chief Skills Officer at IEDC Bootcamp SJCET Palai. This role has further enhanced my leadership skills and exposed me to diverse skill development initiatives.

### Portfolio Highlights


#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I’ve worked on a few open-source projects, focusing on making things easier for everyday users. One of my main projects is the WhatsApp Message Bot, which helps users send bulk WhatsApp messages using contact details from an Excel sheet. It’s built with Python and makes messaging faster by automating the whole process.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  I engage in various technical communities, mainly through coding platforms like Exercism and HackerRank. Here, I not only work on improving my skills but also share solutions to help fellow developers. I have participated in TryHackMe, enhancing my cybersecurity knowledge and competing in challenges​.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- While I haven’t contributed much to technical blogs or video content, my most visible technical contributions are my GitHub repositories. These include detailed coding solutions to challenges from platforms like HackerRank.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- The WhatsApp Message Bot is probably the most useful tool I’ve created so far. It automates the process of sending messages to many contacts, which can save people a lot of time, especially in business or community settings. It’s simple, efficient, and flexible, allowing for custom messages and handling country codes with ease​.[WhatsApp Message Bot](https://github.com/Jibin-Gigi/WhatsApp-Message-Bot)

#### Leadership and Influence:

- As Chief Skills Officer at IEDC SJCET Palai, I spearhead skill development programs by identifying gaps and creating initiatives to address them, showcasing my leadership in community growth. Balancing roles as both an intern and Central Zone Lead at Gtech Mulearn, I demonstrated my ability to influence and lead effectively, reflecting my capacity to inspire and motivate others simultaneously.

#### Networking:

- I'm an effective speaker who enjoys engaging with successful, self-driven individuals and those committed to self-learning. Skilled in marketing, I excel at identifying needs and addressing problems efficiently. I also value collaboration and seek opportunities for extensive teamwork.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- Participating in events like this allows me to gauge current coding trends and assess my skills relative to others. It helps me understand how much more effort I need to invest in learning and adapting to meet industry standards.

#### Career Plan:

- Initially, I will attend industry events to stay abreast of current trends and continuously develop my skills. I plan to join multinational corporations (MNCs) to gain insights into established processes and operations. Following this, I will transition to a startup environment to experience and manage risk scenarios firsthand. With this diverse background, I aim to leverage my accumulated knowledge and experience to eventually establish and lead my own company.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala can shine in the tech startup scene by using its well-educated people and improving infrastructure like tech parks and incubators. By working together with schools and businesses, supporting startups with good policies, and encouraging young people to start their own businesses, the state can create a strong environment for new tech companies. Focusing on specific areas where Kerala can stand out and connecting with global markets will also help attract investment and opportunities, making Kerala a great place for tech innovation.
