# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

### About Me 
> Hello, I am Abhishek S Lal, I worked on API integration part and backend development in Code Spartans at the Top 100 coders finals. Our project aims to help people to get summary of youtube videos by just adding the links of the youtube video in our webapp, allowing them to quickly glace at the important topics and get a brief idea before watching the entire video. Apart from providing video summary, content analysis and video transcription, we plan to bring in a chat feature, to quickly ask queries about the content of the video helping people save long time in understanding the video.

> In the induvidual project submission round, I worked on innovating queue and appointment management solution for small clinics and events. The idea is to provide business a easy platform to list their services and manage appointments or queues quickly by simply creating a linkinbio like page and share it with their customers through QR code or as links. The visitor can visit the page and book appointments. And done. Check out the MVP [here](getmytoken.netlify.app)

#### My Contribution:
- API Integrations and backend setup - Worked on OpenAI's Speech to Text Transcriptions API to generate transcriptions using Whisper data model. Worked on pytube library to download audio from the youtube video. Also added whisper library into the project so that the model can be run locally without calling the Open AI's API.
- In the induvidual project round, I worked on product desinging to simplify the process of setting up a QMS. Worked on a full-stack web app development using Next.js and PostgreSQL.

#### Key Contributions:
- Even though, I have'nt build any python or AI project in the last few years, I have managed to research alternatives and select streamlit library that simplifies the UI development for the data science project. Worked with collaborative spirit to learn other fellow participants and share my knowledge with them.

#### Challenges Overcome
- Some of the hackerrank problems were challenging for me. I have discussed with my colleages to collaboratively solve it. The time constraint to build a valuable useful, scalable product during the induvidual project submission round was a challenge to me. But setting priority feature list and using good coding practices helps me to complete the project in time.

#### Future Enhancements:
- I plan to complete the project I have done during the induvidual project submission round as a SaaS product.
- Planning to take forward the video summarizer chat bot as a google chrome extension to quickly chat with the youtube videos.
  
#### Final Thoughts:
- I always wanted to bring value to the users through my projects. I had experience of building impactful products(Campuzon APP during Covid period). Being in Top 100 will help me to work with like minded people and collaborative bring impactful products to the society.
