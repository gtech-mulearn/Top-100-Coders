### About Me

> I am a passionate Computer Science and Engineering student, driven by the convergence of technology and design. With a penchant for crafting intuitive, visually appealing user interfaces, I've honed my skills through project-based learning. I work with Java, C and JavaScript and enjoy diving into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). My creativity finds expression through Figma, where I've completed impactful UI/UX projects. Additionally, my journey has included working as an intern in various companies and actively participating in communities, which have significantly contributed to my experience. I've been immersed in front-end web development for the past six months, during which I've undertaken projects, and I remain committed to furthering my learning in this area. My goal is to create solutions to problems through design and technology. I'm enthusiastic about collaboration and always open to new opportunities.
