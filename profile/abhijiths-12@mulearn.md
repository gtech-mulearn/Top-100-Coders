### About Me

>I am a 2nd year student at Mar Baselios College Of Engineering and Technology in Kerala doing my graduation in computer science and engineering, I possess coding expertise in Python, Java, C, and R programming. I strongly believe in the transformative power of merging technical prowess with finance. Since the inception of my engineering journey, I've been steadily cultivating a strong foundation in financial skills. This intersection of technology and finance holds the potential for revolutionary advancements.


### Portfolio Highlights



#### Leadership and Influence: `required field`

- As a part of a course named Professional communication in my curriculum , I have had lead a team to develop a project and present it to my classmates for the successful completion of the project.Me also as a part of the college cricket team and club teams have explored myself and worked along side my seniors to develop strategies in games and delivered them to win titles and games.
