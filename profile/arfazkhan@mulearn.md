# Arfaz Khan Hijas Khan (The Not So Average Tech Enthusiast)

### About Me

> I'm not your typical tech enthusiast; You can picture me as someone with a flair for creativity and a pinch of humor. In a world where algorithms rule and code is king, I've carved my niche by bringing innovation and a touch of fun to every project. While currently pursuing my B.Tech in Electronics & Communication Engineering, I have gained and learnt valuable experience over the past four years in the field, I'm all about bridging the gap between technology and user-friendly design. Currently, I'm on a mission to make the world a more exciting place through technology, one line of code at a time.


### Portfolio Highlights


#### Leadership and Influence:

- In the tech domain, leadership isn't just about giving orders; it's about inspiring others to push boundaries. I've led a dynamic team of developers at the District Tourism Promotion Council, where we're creating a mobile app that's turning tourism into an adventure. Through UX case studies and agile methodologies, I'm steering the ship towards a user-centric paradise.

#### Networking: 

- I'm not just a techie; I'm a people person too! As a Flutter IG State Facilitator, I've hosted weekly gatherings where we brainstorm and innovate. I don't just connect; I create synergies that move mountains. Imagine coordinating a 15-member team across 26 committees for a grand Onam Celebration - that's networking on steroids. I'm all about making waves in the tech community, one connection at a time. My secret sauce? Building bridges, forging connections, and sparking collaborations that ignite my comfort space. As a Top 100 coder, I plan to sprinkle my networking magic, bringing like-minded techies together. Imagine a galaxy of tech enthusiasts orbiting around a shared vision - that's what I bring to the table.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- Why am I applying for the Top 100? Well, it's simple. I see it as the VIP pass to the future. Also, because I'm ready to level up! Being in the Top 100 is like adding rocket fuel to my career. It's the launchpad for new opportunities, collaborations, and the chance to contribute to the ever-growing Startup Ecosystem. 

#### Career Plan: 

- My plan? It's a mix of tech expertise, entrepreneurial drive, mentorship, and a vision for Kerala's technology startup ecosystem. The big picture: I aim to launch a groundbreaking hardware-software fusion as a visionary entrepreneur.

- But here's the twist. I'm also gearing up to unveil an educational marvel—a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) powered study aid. It offers personalized feedback, revolutionizing how students learn. As an electronics engineer, I'm not just building a product; I'm leading a learning revolution.

- That's not all. Simultaneously, I'm diving into the field of engineering management. I plan to study further in this domain, equipping myself to guide and lead budding engineers. Because life isn't just about tech; it's about nurturing and mentoring the tech leaders of tomorrow.

- Now, let's talk about the future of Kerala's technology startup ecosystem. I firmly believe that Kerala has the potential to shine on the global tech stage. To excel, we need a thriving community of innovators, mentors, and leaders. My career plan aligns perfectly with this vision. By fostering innovation, mentoring new talent, and launching groundbreaking tech solutions, I intend to be a catalyst for Kerala's tech startup success story.

- Picture this: I'm more than an entrepreneur; I'm an innovator, a leader, a mentor, and a contributor to Kerala's tech evolution. Brace yourself for a future where tech and education merge, guided by my expertise in engineering and a commitment to nurturing Kerala's tech ecosystem. 

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

- Kerala's tech future is brimming with possibilities. To excel, we need to nurture talent from grassroots, invest in cutting-edge technology, and create an environment that fosters innovation. With the right mix of talent and resources, Kerala can be the Silicon Valley of the East.

  #### History of Open Source Contributions:

- While my journey in open-source contributions is just beginning, I am incredibly enthusiastic about diving into this dynamic community. I am in the process of exploring various open-source projects, aiming to contribute actively in the near future. My passion for technology and my commitment to learning and growing in the open-source space drive my determination to make meaningful contributions to upcoming projects. 

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  My history of community engagement in a technical capacity is a blank canvas eagerly awaiting vibrant strokes of participation. While I may not have a past track record, I'm ready to embrace the world of technical communities with open arms. I am dedicated to actively participating in discussions, providing solutions, and sharing knowledge to become a valued member of these communities in the near future.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- In the world of technical content creation, I'm gearing up to make a splash. While my portfolio might not be filled to the brim yet, I have exciting plans in the pipeline. I'm plan to work on a series of technical blog posts and articles aimed at simplifying complex concepts for readers of all backgrounds. From coding tutorials to deep dives into emerging technologies, my goal is to create content that not only educates but also inspires.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- Ever heard of the ResumeAlly AI tool? That's my brainchild, helping job seekers create winning resumes

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- Catch me conquering competitive websites like Exercism, where I completed the challenging Dart track. It was this very challenge that ignited the spark of curiosity in me, propelling me into the enchanting world of mobile development using Flutter. From Dart challenges to Flutter mastery, I'm on a journey of continuous learning and innovation. Watch out for my digital footprints; they're the trail markers of my tech adventure.
