### About Me

> I am currently a third year student in B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering. My journey has always been for my unquenched thirst for knowledge. I have a foundation in coding. Furthermore, my interest in AI and Data Science has enabled me to learn about various concepts.
I am actively engaged in projects that aim to assist differently abled children by means of technology and interactive applications.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Currently holding position as CEO in IEDC, has organized and conducted many events like IoT Bootcamps and various other. Currently working on evening culture which promotes technical knowledge and innovation in the campus.
- Co-lead of FOSS United campus chapter.

#### Networking: 

- Bieng a part of IEDC, I had connecred with various other collages execoms which promoted my experience level.
- IG intern of MuLearn which had a great impact in my Networking.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As a student who envisions to reach the peak of AI and Data Science or at least leave a lasting impression on it, I have never been in a professional environment wherein I could apply my skills to their best. I expect being a part of top 100 will give me an opportunity to show the world what I can do in my realm, if given a chance.
- Like I mentioned before, I am very keen on the fact that I would like to give back to the very society that nurtured me. That being said, I would not like to forget my roots, and hence take up one, if not many of the tasks or innovations and implement them in the best fashion possible.

#### Career Plan: 

- My immediate plans are to get into  AI & DS and then from there expand my knowledge as required. I would not like to limit myself to a particular field, nor would I like to be a Jack of all trades. Hence I picked these two domains to remain committed to, both in the short term, as well as the long term and leave a lasting impact or a relatable vision that the future leaders of my country can pick up on.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has many a numerous, vibrant students which are been enlighted during last few years. There can be a exponential growth in Kerala's Tech Ecosystem.

#### History of Open Source Contributions
