#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

Kerala should focus on research more, since research is always one step ahead comparing to the current market technology. Therefore, if we can get a new technology in our hand, there opens a way to use that in market. Also I think that research policy should also focus on all Colleges and not just Top colleges like IIT.
