# Abdul Hakkeem P A 

### About Me

> I am a passionate `full-stack engineer` with experience in developing production-quality applications based on Python and JavaScript frameworks. I have experience deploying these applications to production, including both server applications and serverless containers. Additionally, I have intermediate knowledge in `AI applications, machine learning, deep learning, and recommender systems`. Currently, I primarily research `LLMs`, `MLOps`, and AI for social good and fintech applications. I aim to develop products with clean and minimal user interfaces. In the cloud domain, I have utilized both `GCP` and `AWS` for various tasks. I love to organize tech events, workshops, hackathons, and developer conferences. I have delivered over 10 talks and workshops on various technology-related topics and events.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- [Make-a-Ton](https://2023.makeaton.in/) Hackathon:
As the lead organizer of Make-a-Ton, Keralaâ€™s first Major League Hacking-affiliated university hackathon, I scaled the event from 80 to 180 participants by leading a cross-functional team of 30 across operations, media, and tech. I secured significant sponsorships from startups and IT companies, held regular meetings with MLH and college officials, and provided technical mentorship to participants. This role required strategic planning, team collaboration, and effective stakeholder management, helping establish a robust hackathon culture at our university.

- [Execom Member, Google Developer Groups (GDG) Cloud Kochi](https://gdg.community.dev/gdg-cloud-kochi/):
At GDG Cloud Kochi, I actively contribute to building a developer community by strategizing and analyzing engagement initiatives. I volunteer in socially impactful programs, facilitate workshops, and curate hands-on events focused on Google Technologies. Through designing educational activities and securing resources, I ensure high-impact, tech-driven learning experiences for participants, fostering professional growth and community impact.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:
- I developed a tool called [Accent Ace](https://accent-ace.vercel.app/) to analyze pronunciation and suggest relevant improvements to users during the Google AI Hackathon. This tool has received over 50 users.



#### Networking:

- Demonstrated active networking through leadership roles in hackathons and tech communities, connecting with founders, developers, and industry experts.
- I would like to connect with like-minded individuals in the 100-Coder community, as well as other startup founders and industry leaders across Huddle Global. Building these connections will foster collaboration and inspire new ideas as we work together.


#### As a Top 100 Member:
- Being recognized as a Top 100 Coder will significantly enhance my career and foster professional growth.
- This program would also provide another opportunity to connect with various startup founders and industry leaders, as well as to give back and help the Kerala ecosystem grow.

#### Career Plan:

- My immediate plan is to join an early-stage Kerala startup to gain hands-on scaling experience (0 to 1), focusing on understanding local market dynamics while building a strong network and actively contributing to the local ecosystem.
- My long term goal is to build a deep tech startup to build B2B products, utilizing Kerala's skilled technical talent to create innovative enterprise products capable of competing on a global scale.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has the resources and skilled talent needed to build and deliver high-quality, consumer-focused applications and deep tech products.
- Creating an environment that values experimentation, supports early failures, and encourages entrepreneurs to pursue novel solutions can cultivate a robust, resilient startup ecosystem.
- Stronger collaborations between universities and tech companies can enhance research, drive practical learning, and create job-ready graduates who are well-equipped to contribute to the startup landscape.
