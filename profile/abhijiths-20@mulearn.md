### About Me

> Myself Abhijith S. I am a first-year B.Tech student with a big passion for technology. My journey into the tech world  started when I was 12 years. At that age , the working of computers and different apps in it made me curious. Started learning from HTML , later learned various programming languages including Phython ,C++ and many more. I experimented to build several small apps and clones which was quite interesting and satisfying, thereby increasing my curiosity about how technology works.
Now I have solid fundamentals in different programming languages like HTML, CSS, C, and C++. As a full stack dev, now I have the self-confidence that I can solve any problems using programming and technology. I love to code. As a tech enthusiast, my main hobby is coding..and yeah, a little of chess and badminton makes my day..Currently, I am learning and building projects using generative AI. As technology is getting updated every second in this era, my goal is to keep studying new technologies, building new projects, crafting some startups and staying updated. By the end of my college life , I am pretty sure that I can make something remarkable for the society.
I aim to contribute to the industry, connect with like-minded people, and develop solutions that shape the future through creativity, hard work, and a commitment to lifelong learning.
