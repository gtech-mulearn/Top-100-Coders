### About Me

> I am Ekalavyan S, a 7th-grade student at The School of the Good Shepherd. My passion for coding has been an unshakeable part of my life since the tender age of 9. My coding journey commenced with the fundamentals of Scratch and has since expanded to encompass CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and the exhilarating world of web development.

> The allure of creating something extraordinary from just a few lines of code has never ceased to captivate my imagination. I've channeled this fascination into developing a range of small games and applications, and I'm currently engaged in crafting web applications using the dynamic ReactJS framework. My coding adventure is a continuous odyssey where I'm constantly learning, exploring new programming languages, tools, and cutting-edge techniques.

> Beyond my coding endeavors, I'm a typical 7th-grade student, indulging in the joys of sports, literature, and cinema. However, my heart truly belongs to coding, and I'm eager to venture into the realms of Artificial Intelligence. My goal is to master the full spectrum of skills necessary for a proficient programmer, shaping a future where I can make a meaningful impact with my code.

#### Leadership and Infuence

- I began my coding journey at the tender age of 9, and during our free time, I excitedly showcased my creations to my friends and teachers. My projects ranged from small programs to fun games, and the enthusiasm I shared was infectious. Many of my friends were so inspired that they embarked on their own programming journeys. I had the privilege of guiding them, helping them create their initial programs.

- When Christmas came around, and with the pandemic keeping us apart, I took the lead in organizing the virtual celebration. I developed a website to coordinate the entire event and designed virtual games to ensure that our entire class could actively participate.

- I also dived into coding competitions like Tinkerfest and was delighted to clinch a prize. I shared my knowledge with my teammates, helping them grasp design thinking approaches and fundamental programming concepts.

- My web application skills didn't go unnoticed, and I was even offered an internship at a startup. Currently, I'm collaborating with them to create an application for gym owners.

- Beyond my friends a, I've been a source of inspiration for many students at school. My computer teacher occasionally entrusts me with the task of explaining HTML programs to the class.

- The trust and faith placed in me by my teachers have led to an exciting opportunity. I'm now part of the "Seed the Future Entrepreneur" mission initiated by the Government of India, where I'm actively involved in generating innovative ideas aimed at benefiting society.

#### Networking

- #### Career Plan:

- To enhance the Kerala startup ecosystem, I've devised both immediate and long-term strategies that revolve around promoting innovation, education, and collaboration within the technology startup community. As a young innovator, I intend to provide valuable mentorship through online platforms, workshops, and interactive sessions, championing the application of design thinking approaches to solve real-world problems.

- Furthermore, I aspire to actively participate in incubator programs, which serve as platforms for nurturing the skills of the younger generation while encouraging them to give back to society. My goal is to engage students from schools and colleges in the vibrant innovation hubs, fostering a culture of creativity and entrepreneurship. This collective effort aims to propel Kerala's startup ecosystem towards a brighter and more promising future.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala possesses the latent potential to thrive within the technology startup ecosystem through an integrated approach that encompasses education, policy advocacy, innovation, and cooperation. An imperative shift towards emphasizing STEM education right from early childhood is essential. As a 12-year-old coder, I've experienced firsthand the challenges in finding the right mentorship for my ideas. Thus, instituting a framework within all schools to foster young entrepreneurs and provide dedicated mentors for interested students is vital. Implementing mentorship programs, whereby experienced professionals guide aspiring students, is imperative.

- Furthermore, it is crucial to initiate innovation hubs within schools and colleges, with substantial government backing. These hubs can serve as epicenters for fostering creativity and entrepreneurship, thereby nurturing a culture of innovation. Enabling students to interact with startups and multinational companies, offering internships, and encouraging partnerships, joint projects, and knowledge exchange between startups, academic institutions, and established tech firms can significantly bolster the startup ecosystem.

- In addition, simplifying the market access for young talents, like myself, who create web applications, is essential. By adopting these strategies and nurturing a culture of innovation and collaboration, Kerala can position itself as a leading player in the technology startup arena. The state boasts a rich reservoir of human resources, and by fully harnessing this potential, Kerala can undoubtedly distinguish itself in the technology startup landscape.
