### About Me

I am graduated as Electronics and Communications Eng. from College of Engineering Trivandrum with a passion for software development. I'm the one who believes in the concept of every üêû is an undocumented feature :)


### Portfolio Highlights

#### Leadership and Influence:

I have actively participated in group projects and demonstrated leadership skills by coordinating team efforts and ensuring successful project completion. I aim to further develop these skills through involvement in student organizations and extracurricular activities.

#### Networking:

As a graduate, I am committed to building a strong network within the technology community. I plan to engage with the Top 100 community by attending events, connecting with fellow peers, and seeking mentorship opportunities. Through these interactions, I aspire to both learn from and contribute to the community.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

I am applying for the Top 100 because I believe it will provide a platform for me to learn from experienced professionals and share my fresh perspective as a fresher. Being part of this community will help me bridge the gap between my current technical knowledge and real-world applications, ultimately benefiting my future career in technology.

#### Career Plan:

I am committed to expanding my knowledge in software development while exploring new domains and technologies that align with my interests and goals and in the short term, I aim to gain valuable internship experiences to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios. I aspire to develop skills in product management, understanding how to bring innovative software solutions to market successfully.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

Kerala has good potential in the Technology Startup Ecosystem so far. But it is not properly utilized. To excel this in the future, it should focus on building a robust infrastructure, providing financial support to startups, and fostering a culture of innovation through education and more mentorship programs.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

Currently, I am in the early stages of my technical journey and haven't had the opportunity to make open-source contributions. However, I am eager to explore this avenue as I progress in my studies.

#### History of Community Engagement:

While I haven't engaged in technical community activities yet, I plan to actively participate in platforms like Stack Overflow and tech forums as I gain more knowledge and experience in the field.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

I am in the process of building my technical skills and haven't created highly visible technical content at this time.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

VS Code, Git, MongoDB Compass, Figma, Photoshop

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

As of now, I don't have profiles on competitive websites but I plan to create them as I progress in my technical journey.
