# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

### About Me 
> Hello. My name is Anjali Rajendran. I'm a web developer with expertise in front end development, AI/ML engineer with machine learning, and data analysis expertise. I'm passionate about taking ideas and turning them into reality. My experience in UI development enables me to create a product that's both functional and visually appealing. I've developed AI models for various projects, and I'm always looking for new challenges to help me grow.

#### My Contribution:
- In the project Electro-Demand, I built a model that can predict the energy demand raised during a particular time that the user gives as input, it works on the basis of the climatic conditions and weather patterns it has seen over the past 10 years, and makes a prediction based on it calculating energy demand,  optimal power generation source (solar or hydro) depending on the weather,  total power needed to meet demand, power generation by source (solar and hydro) for user-specified inputs.

#### Key Contributions:
- This web application is a sample of that system that predicts energy-related parameters including weather, energy demand, and power generation based on historical data. It utilizes machine learning models trained on a dataset containing weather, energy production, and demand information. Users can input a date and optionally provide temperature and rainfall values to receive predictions about energy-related factors.

#### Challenges Overcome
- Challenge I faced the most was time management and proper reource utilization.

#### Future Enhancements:
- As future work planning to expand the model with more features that is access to more database can significantly improve the model, adding consumption of electricity from household levels yearly or possibly monthly can improve the models performance in determining the electricity demand, also integrate weather apis for multiple locations to expand the system's reach. 

As an extended work, a sub app for this if reached within the household levels we can integrate an alarm system, for energy consumptionlevel ntifyin the user that they are utilizing too much electricity.

#### Final Thoughts:
- My contribution to the electro-demand not only challenged me but also allowed me to grow as a developer and introduce myself to some new error and their fixes. I'm proud of what I've achieved and excited to learn about the potential impact of my project.
