# Proof of Work

### My Contribution

Hello, I'm Amjed Ali, a full stack developer. I created the entire project from scratch, including the backend, frontend, and database.

### Key Contributions

Discord Js: Connected the Discord bot to the backend services, enabling users to interact with the bot and receive real-time environmental data.
Dashboard: Worked on a dashboard using Next js, Tailwind CSS and Shadcn. The dashboard allows users configure their server and subcriptions to the bot.
Database Management: Designed and managed the PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

### Challenges Overcome

Primary challenge for me is creating a discord bot using node js, which i don't have any prior experience.

### Future Enhancements

Looking ahead, I plan to add subscription model and diffrent flavours to the bot response. In future, bot will be able to provide diffrent kind of responses other than sarcasm

### Final Thoughts

Working on this project was a great learning experience for me. I was able to learn new technologies and improve my skills. I look forward to working on more projects like this in the future.
