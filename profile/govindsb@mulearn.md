### About Me

Hey I am Govind S B, a 3rd year CSE student who likes to tinker with tools and build things for fun nothing more nothing less, I do not like to label myself as a "stack" engineer but by convention I belong to the backend group. I like to empower other folks to build stuff and seeing them grow makes me happy.

If you want to check me out , I am active on twitter [`@violetto96`](https://twitter.com/violetto96) and check my mail `b.s.dnivog@gmail.com` regularly.

### Portfolio Highlights

- [EHSA](https://github.com/Govind-S-B/ExamHall-SeatAllocator)  
  A GUI application built in Flutter, Rust, and Python that automates the assignment of student seats in examinations and generates appropriate PDFs
  Its the first major software I ever wrote open source with a userbase , It started out as a custom application built from the scratch up for my college's personal needs but over time it evolved into an adaptable system
  If you are checking out the project , please check out the extensive wiki we wrote. Good documentation is often overlooked.

- [Certify](https://github.com/Govind-S-B/Certify)  
  A very WIP project that is trying to simplify the certificate generation , authentication and related communication tasks

- [QRScanner Overlay](https://github.com/Govind-S-B/qr_scanner_overlay)  
  A QRScanner Overlay package that I wrote for a qr scanner package that I was already using. It didnt support images out of the box so I just made a package that does that.
  

#### Leadership and Influence: 

- I am right now building a tech enthusiast focused builder culture in Trivandrum under my own capacity [A tweet on that](https://twitter.com/violetto96/status/1713514205993927150)
- I built a tech team from the ground up that just focuses on building stuff without any other distractions. The folks in the team really like it here and I was able to get a few people into tech because of this,
  I like to measure my impact not in quality but in impact generated and these folks attest to that
- I head a few positions in my college : TinkerHub TechLead , GDSC TechLead , IEDC CFO

In the end its just that I just like seeing people grow , and I think thats what a lot of leaders lack and want. A real passion to do things for the community cause .. you just love doing it

#### Networking: 

- I tweet a lot and twitter gives you exposure to people in a very free form manner. I was able to connect with many community folks just by showing genuine interest in what they are doing.
- I hang around at discord servers for some projects and get to meet a lot of cool people there.
- I believe that I have a high quality network around me right now and I use the network of my closer networks to connect with folks I have interest in and that should help with connecting with folks at top 100 coders.
- I run a few community meet up like initiatives so as a host I get to meet cool people there as well.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- I want to meet cool people who build cool stuff, being around such a circle will with no doubt improve ones skill. I want that environment, I want to be associated with that its a simple grounded reasoning without any pretence.
- And I also want to show peopel around me that its not that hard to really get into this space, meet folks, proving your mettle. I want to prove to folks that If I can get things done you can too.

#### Career Plan: 

- Long Term : I want to grow people from scratch tech enthusiasts who just tinker with whatever things they can get their hands on , A literal offline space where people can come over and experiment as a group similar to buildspace and
  thereby get the confidence to work on any idea they feel like doing. We have online communities , but an offline culture is severely lacking and if we get that up with a passionate person up top it will work!
- Short Term : The same thing above but in a very very lower capacity but just under my name so that I can have control over what the vision is without it being muddied up with stakeholders that have different motives

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

- We have a lot of ideators and builders but there is a lack of visibility of what is happening. We need more tech focused offline hackerspaces where people can come and build. Public Parks but make it tech fouced and that should be let
  more people to wander and be intrigured on whats going on.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Wrote the very first iteration of the wiki for https://github.com/iterativv/NostalgiaForInfinity
