### About Me

> I am working as a faculty in the Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering at Mar Baselios College of Engineering And Technology, Thiruvananthapuram. I also oversee Catalyst IEDC and Technology Business Incubation Centre of MBCET. I am interested in building and maintaining networks and am proactively engaged in many social initiatives.  I enjoy taking on new challenging initiatives, especially those that are beneficial for students. I support students in their skill development through various courses designed and developed beyond the curriculum to bridge the gap. I am very much interested in user-centric problem solving and I had multiple funded projects and awards for delivering the same. Throughout my roles as a teacher and mentor, my unwavering commitment has been to inspire and nurture the very best in my students.

#### Leadership and Influence: `required field`

- As a faculty member in the field of electronics, the major area where I consistently demonstrated leadership and influence is Curriculum Enhancement. Leading efforts to revamp and modernize the electronics curriculum to align with emerging technologies and industry trends. For instance, I played a pivotal role in introducing courses on IoT, AI, and embedded systems, ensuring that our students are well-prepared for the industry's future demands. We have also created a lab in collaboration with Intel for working on AI and IoT. 
#### Networking: `required field`

- I enjoy connecting with various communities and actively participate in groups like KSUM IEDC, IETE Gtech MuLearnetc. These communities have greatly contributed to my professional growth. 
My primary goal is to connect with top coders, and that's why I aim to participate in the top 100 coders' community.
#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- I have a passion for coding, and I see this as a valuable opportunity to enhance my coding skills. The experience gained from this endeavor will enable me to better mentor and guide my students in their own coding journeys.
#### Career Plan: 
- The startup ecosystem in Kerala is encountering difficulties in attracting skilled technical professionals. I plan to help students improve their technical skills, thereby offering technical support to the ecosystem. I also intend to remain actively involved within the ecosystem.
#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

Kerala's Startup ecosystem has flourished and grown immensely after the inception of the Kerala Startup Mission. One major challenge still exists is the co-founders' lack of empathy and core technological problem-solving abilities.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Associated with ICFOSS in setting up FOSS cell in the college. Interested in LoRaWAN 
#### History of Community Engagement:

-  Discuss your history of community engagement in a technical capacity, such as answering questions on platforms like Stack Overflow or actively participating in technical forums like mailing lists and Discord servers.
