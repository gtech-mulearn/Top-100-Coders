### About Me

> Hi There, I'm Abhilash. Finished My Bachelor's degree in 2022, Got My first Official Job last year December, Currently working as a full-time React-Native Developer In Picky Assist Pvt Ltd Trivandrum.


### Portfolio Highlights



#### Leadership and Influence: 

- I started tinkering with Computers and Computer Applications at the early age of 12, this early start in this domain has given me an edge. I have used this advantage to climb to the top on many occasions, I used to teach my friends about computers when I was in school, I used to be a coordinator on a tech forum when I was in college, and most important of all I played a huge role on my first inter-ship as the mobile development teams, team-lead.

#### Networking: 

- Social Media never was my strong suit, but still, I always had some experience in networking and others. I can hold a conversation pretty well both in-person and online and about my digital presence, Anyone could find me with a google search, that something right?!

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- Being top 100 means, I'm not your run-of-the-mill average programmer. This will help me land on better position in my current job and my future jobs. The most important thing is I could influence many people and in return get influenced by so many others, I believe this will make me even better at my craft.

#### Career Plan: 

- My career as a developer just started a year ago, My intermediate plan for the future will be to expand my horizons by meeting new people improving my skills, and landing the best job position, But my long-term goal is to making my own company, a start-up you could say, where people like me and myself do whatever we like, as for career plan i will think of it when the time comes.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

- Our State has some smart people, just like any other field our education is not exceptional, it's hitting every point, but that's it. College and degree courses are just the bare minimum, to survive this new era developers need to collaborate and convey their vision with each other. If we could get some opportunity like that, to find the bigger fish rather than swimming in our small pond then that development.
