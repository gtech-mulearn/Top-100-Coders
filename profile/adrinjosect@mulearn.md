### About Me

  - I'm a third year student at Muthoot Institue of Technology and Science with a passion for Full Stack Development, primarily focusing on web development. I have a solid foundation in various web technologies including but not limited to: Tailwind, React, Vue, Nextjs, Nuxtjs, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, and many more. Languages I'm proficient in include Javascript, C, Java, Python. I have sharpened my skills in problem-solving and algorithm design through the various projects I have done over the past few years. I'm currently working as a Junior Web Developer at a company Vexvo, working on developing websites for their various clients. I have made plenty of websites for my college in my free time inorder to keep my skills sharp and through this have managed to become the web developemnt lead at most of the clubs in my college. I'm also quite interested in cloud computing and have spent time familiarising myself with various cloud providers like AWS and GCP. My ultimate goal is to become a full fledged full stack developer capable of completing the entire process of building an app from start to finish. I plan to expand my skillset towards android development and desktop development in the future and have started learning Jetpack Compose as the first step.

#### Leadership and Influence: 

- I meet the qualifications of being a leader in my domain because of I have contionously demonstrated those qualities over various events. A few of them would be:
  - I'm the Technical Lead for the Media Club at my college. Here I create and manage websites for the various events that happen at my college. Two notable examples would be Shreshta and Varnam 2023. These were sensations events and I'm proud to be the lead developer behind them. I along with my team created websites for both events were responsible for the technical side of the event. I was also the lead developer for the media club website which was launched recently and was able to successfully lead the team to the completion of the website within deadlines.
  - Speaking of Shreshta 2023, I was invloved in helping out at the Nexus Gaming Lounge which was conducted as part of Shreshta. I've set up one of the gaming sections and was coordinating one of the tournements.
  - Moving on I'm the Development Team Mentor at TinkerHub MITS where my team is currently working on the TinkerHub MITS website which is almost complete. Along with this I also teach web development to those willing to learn through the various events that TinkerHub conducts. A example would be Grey Space which is featured on my Linkedin.
  - I've recently become the Web Development Lead at GDSC MITS and their website is currently in the works. There are various web dev events planned in the future which I would be leading.
  - I've attended various hackathons over the past 3 years and was able to lead the team to success.

  - I have attended a number of events at TinkerSpace allowing me to make valuable connections with various industry leads.
  - I attended FOSS Kochi which was held at MEC last year which gained me more valuable connections.
  - I try to be active on various platforms like Linkedin, Reddit, Discord, etc.
  - I have attended multiple hackathons and have made several connections at the events.

#### As a Top 100 Member:
