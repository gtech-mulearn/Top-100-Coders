### About Me

> I am currently a third year student in B.Tech Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. My journey has always been for my unquenched thirst for knowledge. I have a foundation in coding, AI and ML. Furthermore, my interest in cybersecurity has enabled me to learn about various concepts in networks, linux etc and how to manipulate and navigate my way through various vulnerabilities. I am actively engaged in projects that aim to assist differently abled children by means of technology and interactive applications.

#### Leadership and Influence:

- Currently holding position as Associate VP of Division H in Toastmasters and have also been an active member, hence i am able to command and interact with a team very well.
- I have organized CTF's and various other events during Shreshta, one of the most prestigious tech fests in the state.
- I have been assigned the role cybersecurity mentor in my college, hence it is my duty to lead the cybersecurity prospects in my college in their career.

#### Networking: 

- Being a part of many projects, i know how important a team is to getting your goals checked off, I try my best to put myself out there and get to connect with as many people as i can.
- I will try to connect to as many people I can find, not only within my doman, but also outside of mine so that we do not simply amplify our strengths, rather cover each others weaknesses as I believe that that is what makes a good team.
- I will, if given a spot in the top 100 try to bring as many of the peoplw I met and acquainted with, back onto a project that I am assigned as I respect them as professionals and would love to see what they can bring to the table.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As a student who envisions to reach the peak of cybersecurity or at least leave a lasting impression on it, I have never been in a professional environment wherein I could apply my skills to their best. I expect being a part of top 100 will give me an opportunity to show the world what I can do in my realm, if given a chance.
- Like I mentioned before, I am very keen on the fact that I would like to give back to the very society that nurtured me. That being said, I would not like to forget my roots, and hence take up one, if not many of the tasks or innovations and implement them in the best fashion possible.

#### Career Plan: 

- My immediate plans are to get into Cybersecurity or AI & DS and then from there expand my knowledge as required. I would not like to limit myself to a particular field, nor would I like to be a Jack of all trades. Hence I picked these two domains to remain committed to, both in the short term, as well as the long term and leave a lasting impact or a relatable vision that the future leaders of my country can pick up on.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has many, if not the best talent in the whole country. Furthermore, there are many government initiatives as well that support and try to nurture this talent. My thoughts are that many of these initiatives remain hidden and far from reach of many people as they arent aware of it, hence they go for the cliche "abroad, make money situation". We must provide as well as spread awareness as to what their opportunities are so that we manage to retain all, if not most of the talent that we so carefully bring up in our state.

># Proof of Work
>### My Contribution:
>
>Hi, I'm Aanand and I worked along with Adish for integrating the BAP and BPP, which is a part of the Beckn protocol, for our project-"Talent Hub". I was in charge of handling the BAP whose main role is to issue requests to all the BPP's and then collect data from them and push it to the front end.
>
>### Key Contributions:
>
>I was in charge of the BAP portion of the protocol, whose main job is to accept requests from the front end in the form of queries which are then passed to the Becken Gateway which further forwards it to all the providers who have been registered in the becken register. Then, we filter these requests and give it back to the front end through some callback api's like (on_search,on_status) which are standard becken formats of the received data. Then they are forwarded back to the front end wherein a plethora of features can be implemented so as to give the end users a seamless view of all of the services in one go.
>Working together: I worked with my fellow team members and efficiently divided the tasks to provide seamless and easy integration between the different spheres of the project.
>### Challenges Overcome:
>
>The biggest challenge for me was my lack of experience with hackathons, but due to the friendly and family like cohesive feeling of the group, top100 coders, enabled me to feel at ease and helped me improve as well as learn alot about how to approach a problem statement, or a hackathon
>The second challenge was that the implementation of a protocol, unlike a website or a mobile application was a very different take for a hackathon problem statement, which also managed to throw a lot of us off track. Many of us faced the same problems but our mentors, especially Faiz sir and Anil sir who helped us a lot to implement this new technology.
>
>### Future Enhancements:
>
>In the future, being a new and upcoming technology whose analogues have performed very well in other domains, I know that the scope of this protocol is boundless and India can surely come up to lead the next big software development from the forefront, with proper use of innovations like the Beckn protocol.
>
>### Final Thoughts:
>
>Working on something that was way out of my league helped me improve my collaboration skills and helped me learn a ton of new skills, as well as learn a lot about the new innovation - Beckn protocol, as well as join more hackathons so as to learn and implement more new technologies and expand my arsenal.
