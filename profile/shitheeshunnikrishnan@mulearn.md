Hello, I am Shitheesh, A Javascript developer in the team which built the WebShot Rater. Our project WebShot Rater which helps the business to evaluate their landing page for better lead conversion.

>### Key Contributions:

> ChatGPT prompting : Experimented the ChatGPT API to built a prompt which evaluate the webpage efficiently. Tried different combinations of prompts to build the reliable solution.

>ChatGPT API Integration : Crreated an PHP function in the backend to transmit the uploaded website screenshot to chatGPT and getting the analysed result from OPEN AI.

>JSON Extract from Text : Created a function to extract the JSON from the chat GPT response, chatGPT most cases gives the json with some additional texts in it which makes it invalid, SO created a function to extract the JSON using regex.


>### Challenges Overcome:
>
>One of the most significant thing happened in the top100 was able to complete the side project which i have in my mind. And with the collaboration with other developers helped to complete the project much faster. Also the way of chosing the problems we are going to solve.

>### Future Enhancements:
>
>Looking ahead, I am planning to create set of developer tools like data converters, API testing tools, Some DB tools. Earlier I have created some JSON management tools as a part of Top100 project submission task. Also have learned about Beckn which is an intresting domain which will i definitely lookup in upcoming days.

>### Final Thoughts:
>
>Participating the top 100 event was one of the important event in my professional career. It actually helped me to start one of my side projects which i was planning for years. Also another important thing was the mentors who are in the event, they guided me on selecting the actual real world problem instead of what we have in our mind. So these two things will definitely have an positive impact in my career. Also learning about beckn protocol and ONDC Network will going to have huge impact in my career.
