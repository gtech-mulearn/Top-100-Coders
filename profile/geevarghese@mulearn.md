### Portfolio Highlights


#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- I was a contributor to the RMX2006 community back in 2018 where I used to build custom ROMs for them.
- Currently a tester for the RMX3310 series devices helping the community keep the device alive even thought Realme will pull the plug within a few months

#### History of Community Engagement:

- My technical skills date back to 2016 when I first rooted my phone and started installing custom ROMs in that.
- Ever since I have been helping people out in Telegram support groups for various devices and recently got introduced into the world of hackintosh

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:

- [KODOMO](https://kodomo-firebase.web.app/) - Entry for google's Build with Gemini Hackathon
	- First ever app that has been released into the public which was completely built by me
- [Project Saadhna Winner](https://medium.com/google-cloud/project-saadhna-cycle-2-is-complete-c06147b566cd) - 6th Position in Google's Project Saadhna

#### Highly Used Software Tools:

- If you've developed software tools that are widely used by users (not just contributors), mention them.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- Not active in competitive websites

#### Leadership and Influence:

- I always believe in the fact that there are people better than me and that alone drives to help people climb up to greater heights than me, The support groups in Telegrams often do get toxic and annoying for new comers but I personally myself mentored people to build custom ROMs and to deploy them and helped them reach higher heights than I could achieve.

#### Networking:

- Being an extrovert is my bling, I interact and mingle with people with  efficiently and effectively. I can get people to talk comfortably around me and hence building a personal relationship is perfectly fine for me.
- In a group , to complete a task , I am awesome in learning new things in a short span of time, allowing me to support the team quickly even if it was something I don't know about

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- I got the information that to be a top 100 coder , you not only code well , you think creatively , you network efficiently and work for a better cause and hence I think I seem fit to be part of the top 100 coders.
- Being a top 100 coder and my knowledge in diverse fields, I will be able to mentor and contribute to a wider spectrum of fields rather than a niche group.

#### Career Plan:

- I currently have a plan on beginning a startup which will aid education sector.
- And honestly everyone needs money so first 5 years after graduation would be definitely to get financially stable myself and then later on focus myself more into the start-up

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala has a very (awesome) tech ecosystem with almost all global clubs and organizations having events and venues in Kerala for their meetups and conferences.
- My niche groups are very weird , Custom ROMs , Hackintoshing and everywhere I went , I saw at least one person from Kerala which shows that Kerala's tech ecosystem is just amazingly incorporated
