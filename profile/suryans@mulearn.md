# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

### About Me 
> I'm S Suryan, B.Tech CSE student from University College of Engineering Kariavattom. I'm a passionate developer who is very much dedicated in contributing to society via being a developer as a practitioner. My coding journey started years back and from then on I was always keen in learning new things. Other than being a developer I enjoy participating in many community engagements related to tech.

#### My Contribution:
- In the past few years i have worked in varying fields in Industries from automation to creating own libraries for solving issues faced by develoepr communities. Among one of those is my on goinng project called AugmentiX, published in PyPi as an image augmentation package for YOLO based training. Other than that i have conducted many FOSS related activities and  engagements. Few of my other open source contributions involve Certificato, Precio etc.

#### Key Contributions:
- My biggest acheivement as a student and as a developer was the one time me along with few other collegues collaborated together to conduct one of the biggest web dev programs with almost 470 + participations. And even had a honour to take a session. Certificato was another biggest acheivement which is an Open source application to streamline the workflow for certificate distributions. 

#### Challenges Overcome
- Acheiving GRIT itself is among the most hardest challenges i had to overcome. Being able to continue something that you are both fond of and even having a chnage of loosing up is always tough.

#### Future Enhancements:
- I would like to streamline my carreer path more narrower for better understanding myself.I would like to restart few of the lost ideas and projects I had to loose back in touch and be an active player in major changes in society.

Being such an enthusiast person in this field, i belive the ideas and ideologies which i contributed and is part of being acted up would always contribute for the comming years.

># Proof of Work: Synopysor-Pro
>### My Contribution:
>
>Hello, I'm Suryan and I'm a solo participant being both the ideator and the active player for my team DynamyX. About the project, this is a content summarization package developed in python - Streamlit. Have used OpenAI's GPT3 API for the summarization and Q and A chatbot. 
>
>### Key Contributions:
>
>Since being using streamlit as the driving application for the project, the objective was to develop with a library that is easy to prototype and vizualise. Streamlit is a python package for developing Web front for an application including both logical backend and other features.
>
>### Challenges Overcome:
>
>One of the significant challenges was choosing the pipelines for sumarization. THough OpenAI's API was available, i was under the constraint of utilizing it without exhausting the credits. I have tried many sumarization models like google's t5 models etc and eventually decided to go with OpenAi API itself. Several layers of iterations were made to amke the application workable. 
>
>### Future Enhancements:
>
>Would love to enhance features like visual recognition based sumarization models inlcuing playlist based sumarization for quick insight retrievals. Would also like to check out other features which could amek this more reachable and useful.
>
>### Final Thoughts:
>
>This was my first hackathon being a solo team member and this helped me understand the stress, the difficulties, the advantages and experience i gained being one of the finalists.
