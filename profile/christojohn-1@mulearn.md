### About Me

Currently I am a final year BCA student at Mar Augusthinose College Ramapuram, where I am developing a strong foundation in programming, web development, and project management. Currently I am learning React.js and I love JavaScript the most. I have a bunch of web apps that I built during my college days which are based on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and firebase as well as React.js. I am also familiar with C, C++, SQL, PHP, and Java which are core languages taught in BCA. Since first year Ioved programming and what I enjoyed the most is coding and fixing errors in my code. Whenever I encounter some error popping up, it makes me eager to find the cause, research on it and finally fix it with own effort. Sometimes it frustrates me but still I enjoys the process a lot. I was introduced to the domain of competitive coding and got interested in it a while ago. I started learning data structures and algorithms which made my coding journey smoother. When I heard about Top 100 coders, what came to my mind first was that this is the perfect stage to test my abilities in problem solving and programming. I look forward to the series and hope to make an impact on the community at the same time measuring my own abilities.
