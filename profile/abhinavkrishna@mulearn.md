### About Me

> I am Abhinav Krishna, a student of class 10. I am a self-taught developer with skills in many programming languages and a Linux Enthusiast. I am a fast learner and have managed to master many different technical skills and especially programming languages. I am passionate about it and I am especially proficient in the alien technology of Lisp and I have very good knowledge of web development, low-level development(with Rust and C), and even a bit of SQL

### Portfolio Highlights

#### Leadership and Influence:
I have held several leadership positions in school, e.g in the Mathematics club. I have shown excellence in all of them. I am good at organising a team and working towards a goal. I always take initiative in school to organise. I am popular in school among both my teachers and with my peers, and something of a teacher myself. I believe that these skills will help me in leading a team of developers as well.

#### Networking:

I am good at communicating with others and working in a team. Though a bit old fashioned(todo.txt), I am good at organising a project and working steadily towards a goal. I have a passion for learning and I love exchanging my knowledge with other people. Especially due to my experience in Lisp, I am good at expressing my thoughts in idiomatic, clean code, which is underrated in many software projects.

#### As a Top 100 Member:
- I want to meet other people with the same interests as me and share knowledge and ideas.
- I will get to interact with many professionals and see how they do it.

#### Career Plan:
In the future I plan to work in this field, especially in a startup. I believe that my skills could help solve many real-world problems. Top100Coders will help me get closer to this dream.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
Kerala, as an educated state, has the perfect ecosystem for a tech boom and in the future it has the possibility to become the tech hub of India. The Kerala Government is paving the way for this with its numerous initiatives. I am lucky to be here at this moment to take part in this.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
I have several open source contributions and projects in other accounts. However this github account is rather sparse. I will be migrating some of those projects here.

#### History of Community Engagement:
I am rather active on Reddit tech communities, especially those centered around Linux.

# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

### About Me
> I am Abhinav Krishna. A student of 10th from Palakkad and an enthusiast of programming.

#### My Contribution:
- I worked in the backend of a Beckn team. During my spare time I also tinkered a bit with a small OpenAI Demo. It was interesting to work with a highly asynchronous API such as Beckn and it was interesting to learn about its architecture

#### Key Contributions:
- Highlight the most impactful or innovative contributions you have made. Explain the significance of these contributions to your field or industry.

#### Challenges Overcome
- We managed to learn about this new technology and how it works. It was a hard task but we managed to do it thanks to some help.

#### Future Enhancements:
- In the future I plan to refine my skills especially in the field of AI as that is where I am the weakest. I have plans to get deeper into practical Programming Language theory as it is a favourite field of mine. I believe my wide skills will help to connect together desperate fields such as the gap between lower and higher level programming languages.

#### Final Thoughts:
- I am a firm believer in that the Art we make with the keyboard can change the world. The Top 100 are the greatest of artists. Even If I do not get that oppertunity this year. I want to continue ascending the ranks of Programming and become a better programmer.
