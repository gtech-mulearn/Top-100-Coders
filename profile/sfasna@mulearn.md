### About Me

> I'm a software developer enthusiast currently a prefinal year student at College of Engineering, Trivandrum (ECE) who loves problem solving and exploring innovative solutions. I specialize in MERN stack development and DevOps with a passion for problem solving (DSA). I gained practical experience as a DevOps developer intern at Flipr.

During my tenure as a __DevOps Developer Extern at Flipr__, I achieved notable milestones in API development, monitoring implementation, and CI/CD stack deployment. My responsibilities included deploying containers, configuring subdomains with Nginx, establishing functional pipelines on Jenkins, and configuring dashboards and alerts in Grafana. This experience deepened my understanding of efficient software deployment practices.

As an __SDE Intern at DesiQnA__, I played a pivotal role in developing a responsive website. I optimized the code for a 60% improvement in user experience and interface. Additionally, I implemented SEO strategies that led to a 90% increase in website traffic. My contributions extended to enhancing security measures, incorporating user verification, and implementing effective bot detection mechanisms.

In the capacity of a __Front-end Developer Intern at Chingu__, I actively participated in the development of a task management website. Utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript, I collaborated with the team on both design and development aspects, gaining valuable experience in teamwork and project coordination.

These professional experiences have not only refined my technical expertise but have also instilled in me the ability to thrive in diverse and dynamic work environments. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my skills to new challenges and contributing to innovative projects.

#### Leadership and Influence: 

I started my college education at TKM College of Engineering and later transferred to CET via S3 college transfer. During my time at TKM, I became involved with IEEE by joining as a __marketing intern__ in IEEE SB TKMCE. This role provided me with exposure to IEEE and motivated me to participate in Encamp training classes, a virtual skill development camp for freshers.

My performance during these sessions led to my selection to organize Encamp 2.O, a six-session program where I was responsible for coordinating and leading different activities. My volunteering activities during Encamp 2.O were recognized with the __"Best Encamper"__ award. Inspired by this experience, I applied for an executive committee position and was selected as the __First Year Representative of IEEE SB TKMCE__.

As the First Year Representative, I helped familiarize first-year students with IEEE, organized events such as the web development boot camp, and assisted seniors in organizing technical and non-technical events such as marketing strategies and personal branding sessions. I also had the opportunity to serve as the __General Volunteer Lead of Renaissance 3.O, the flagship event of IEEE LINK, Kerala Section__. In this role, I mentored a Student Branch and provided them with insights and ideas on how to be more active in IEEE events.

After my college transfer to CET, I continued my volunteering efforts with IEEE SB CET. I contributed to the preparation and registration process of NOVA, a voice-controlled bot workshop conducted by PES. I also helped with general volunteering tasks and anchored some sessions during the recently conducted ASPIRE series event.

Right now, I am the __Women In Tech Lead of GDSC CET__ where as of now helped students delve into software by introducing them to WebDev and DSA.

Through my experiences, I have learned how to plan effective meetings, organize events, and coordinate with other volunteers. My leadership qualities have improved, and I have had the opportunity to help other students  develop new skills.  

#### Networking: 

- I have strong networking skills, and I plan to actively engage with the Top 100 community. I aim to share my knowledge, learn from others, and contribute positively to the community. In my field, I aspire to lead by example, inspire others, and foster collaboration.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

I want to be a Top 100 member to:

1) Connect with skilled programmers.
2) Build professional relationships with like-minded individuals.
3) Seek and share advice easily.
4) Network with potential investors, venture capitalists, and CEOs.

#### Career Plan: 

Right now, I'm diving deep into software, AI, and ML during my B.Tech. Alongside, I'm building a 
startup—an app that provides users with a seamless and user-friendly experience for accessing live inventory information of nearby shops. With an intuitive map interface, customers can effortlessly explore the product availability in their vicinity. Shopkeepers can take advantage of our robust dashboard feature, gaining real-time insights into sales performance and profit analysis. The dashboard also highlights the most demanded products, empowering retailers to make informed decisions and optimize their inventory.
During college, I'll master AI, ML, and DSA—essentials in the tech world—while growing my startup.

After graduation, I'll join a company offering growth, both professionally and personally. This experience will prep me for the next step: giving my startup the boost it needs.

So, it's all about skills now, with AI and ML in focus, while my startup dream takes shape. After college, it's a job that helps me grow, and of course, nurturing my startup on the side.


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

 Kerala, with its rich diversity and a community rooted in education and experience, holds incredible potential. The collective strength of its people can drive impactful initiatives. Imagine revolutionizing healthcare accessibility through innovative mobile applications or making cities more sustainable by increasing number of green buildings, or a future where every individual's needs are at their fingertips through user-friendly apps, shaping a more connected and convenient society. The potential for positive change is boundless.
