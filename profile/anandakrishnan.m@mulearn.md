# Top 100 Finalist - Proof of Work

## My Contribution
Working on our beckn based project 'TalentHub' I have played a key role in UI/UX design, focusing on the visual elements, including the selection of typography and iconography, to enhance the user experience in the project.

## Key Contributions
- Designed the web pages, paying meticulous attention to details such as typography and iconography, to create an engaging and user-friendly interface.
- Screenshots are attached along

## Challenges Overcome
The most significant challenge I faced was ensuring that the visual elements seamlessly complemented the back-end design developed by my fellow teammates.

## Future Enhancements
The current version only deals with details fetched from the MuLearn website. Considering an open network in play, there are plans to implement more websites in the future, creating a decentralized setup. We are planning to integrate websites such as Hackerrank, Leetcode and other skill showcasing platforms.

## Final Thoughts
I believe that the concept of Beckn Protocol, a decentralized commerce system, can have a vast array of uses in the future. Open networks that connect to multiple services within a single interface, without requiring a monolithic system architecture, can undoubtedly change the dynamics of web or app usage even more in the future. The sessions conducted by Mr. Faiz was wonderfully simple and easily understandable.
