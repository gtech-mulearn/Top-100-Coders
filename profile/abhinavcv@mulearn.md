# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

### About Me 
> As a passionate engineering student currently in my third year at the School of Engineering, Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT), pursuing a Bachelor of Technology degree in Information Technology, I am driven to apply technical skills and knowledge to real-world projects. Eager to contribute to the ever-evolving world of technology and innovation and also collaborate with like-minded people from different backgrounds and expertise.


#### My Contribution:
- I contributed to my project by integrating the API and the frontend, as well as connecting the API with the backend and making logical operations on the data recieved on the frontend.

#### Key Contributions:
- I was able to parse the PDF and extract the text out of it and also scraped YouTube to fetch the best study material for the students. Still, the contribution I'm most proud of is keeping a near folder structure and creating a well organized API which could be used in the future to integrate with other applications. And also taking care of environment variables and integrating a Middleware to only allow authenticated users to make API calls.

#### Challenges Overcome
- Integrating & syncing the backend and frontend was probably the hardest part of it all. And Parsing the PDF was also something new.

#### Future Enhancements:
- In future we plan to also enhance this into a production ready SaaS, through which institutions can seamlessly integrate the ChatGPT automated questions and analytics into their application.

#### Final Thoughts:
- First of all, it was an absolute privilege to be here among the Top 100 Coders and was a great opportunity to meet so many like-minded people and has definitely helped me get out of my comfort zone. The project which we have made, I believe, has the potential to be revolutionary if made completely production ready. Teachers won't have to create questions manually anymore. Not just that, teachers can now better understand their class and students and the application is able to send personalized study materials to each student which is beneficial for the student as well.
