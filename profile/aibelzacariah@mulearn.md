### About Me

> I am a passionate 2nd year AI student who excels in brain computer research and also development in both hardware and software, I have won x2 hackathons and has come first for NASA space apps challlenge, 
I got in robotics and coding when I was 13 and have been growing in it. I also have been getting into some entry level cyber security and came in 250's rank for my first CTF that was conducted in OCT (global)
I recently started working on my very own startup with the help from few of my friends to create a multi platform app and a website to provide food for the needy while ensuring proper food waste management 
On my freetime I work on Brain computer research or work with fine tuning AI models while also familirizing myself with some devops.

#### Networking:

- I wish to meet like minded individguals so that i could have more contributers to my projects and also contribute to others cuz I believe having that mindset and having that type of peer to peer learning can help improvig ourselves a lot 
I also want to meet different types of ppeople to learn and know more about the emerging trends in tech.

#### Career Plan:

- My plan is to first work as an ai brain researcher and also closely assosiate with people who are into hardware and some robotics, I want to get enough experience and get back to kerela to start 
a bci startup to help people who are paralyzed and cant walk.. With BCI its possibel to create wheelchairs or stretcherbeds that can be controllled using the patient's brain alone. 
#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Just bring up projects like this could let people come together and work on various stuff.. having some big authority like the governement could also introduce idea which could have collaborators all around kerela to contribute 
which would in turn make it such a success.. Like contributing to something like debian or arch.
