About Me
I am a second-year computer science major student with a deep passion for technology and innovation. Despite being early in my academic journey, I have actively engaged in various projects and formed a functional team at my college to work on software applications and other computer science-related initiatives. One of my current projects involves designing a computer that integrates both analog and digital technologies, aimed at enhancing AI/ML applications.

Portfolio Highlights
History of Open Source Contributions:
While I do not yet have a significant online presence in open-source communities, I am actively working on several projects that I plan to contribute to the open-source ecosystem in the near future. My primary focus has been on building a strong foundational knowledge and practical skills through college projects and team collaborations.

History of Community Engagement:
I have engaged with my peers and professors in a technical capacity within my college. I co-founded a functional team focused on developing software applications and tackling various computer science challenges. This experience has allowed me to share knowledge, collaborate on complex problems, and foster a learning environment.

Highly Visible Technical Content:
As of now, I have not yet published any technical blog posts, articles, or video series. However, I am actively documenting my projects and plan to share my insights and findings through various platforms in the future.

Highly Used Software Tools:
Currently, the software tools and projects I have developed are primarily used within my college. One of the key projects includes the design and implementation of SAAP (a software application), which has been well-received by my peers and faculty.

Competitive Website Profiles:
I do not have active profiles on competitive websites like Exercism, HackerRank, or Kaggle at the moment. My focus has been on hands-on projects and collaborative efforts within my college environment.

Leadership and Influence:
I have demonstrated leadership by forming and leading a functional team at my college. This team focuses on creating innovative software applications and exploring new technologies. My leadership skills are evident in my ability to coordinate team efforts, delegate tasks, and inspire my peers to achieve our common goals.

Networking:
My networking skills are primarily focused on building relationships within my college community. I plan to engage with the Top 100 community by actively participating in discussions, attending events, and collaborating on projects. I aim to influence and lead by sharing my experiences, learning from others, and contributing to the community's collective growth.

As a Top 100 Member:
I am applying for the Top 100 to connect with like-minded individuals and industry leaders who can guide and inspire me. Being part of this community will provide me with opportunities to learn, grow, and contribute to the broader tech ecosystem. It will also help me build a network that is crucial for my career development.

Career Plan:
In the short term, I plan to continue working on my projects and contribute to the Kerala Startup Ecosystem by sharing my knowledge and collaborating with other startups. My project on designing a computer that fuses analog and digital technologies for AI/ML applications has the potential to create numerous job opportunities in the region. By advancing this technology, startups can leverage it to develop innovative AI/ML solutions, leading to new roles in research, development, and deployment of these technologies. In the long term, I aim to leverage my skills and projects to drive innovation in AI/ML, particularly through my work on integrating analog and digital technologies.

Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
I believe Kerala has immense potential to excel in the Technology Startup Ecosystem. By fostering a culture of innovation, providing access to resources, and encouraging collaboration among startups, Kerala can become a hub for technological advancements. My vision is to contribute to this growth by working on cutting-edge projects and sharing my insights with the community. The AI/ML computer project I am working on can also significantly boost the tech ecosystem by creating specialized job roles and attracting talent to the region
