# Ann Maria Jaison


### About Me
> I am a passionate B.Tech student specializing in Cybersecurity at St. Joseph College of Engineering and Technology, Palai. With a background in Computer Science, I have consistently achieved top marks and have actively pursued internships and job simulations to deepen my technical expertise. My experience spans cybersecurity analysis, media internships, and social media marketing, reflecting my commitment to both technical and creative domains. As a Women in Tech Lead for ThinkerHub and an organizer for events like O-Pen Mike, I thrive in collaborative environments and value community engagement. My skills include C++, UI/UX design, video editing, and cybersecurity, and I am keen on freelancing in custom design services like 3D wallpapers and sneaker designs.

### Portfolio Highlights
- **Internships**: Media intern at MU Learn, cybersecurity-focused internship on keylogger software, part-time work in social media marketing for Nextu.
- **Projects**: Developed a To-Do List Application, Random Quote Generator.
- **Hackathons**: Participated in the Smart India Hackathon and Microsoft Student Ambassadors Azure Cloud Challenge.
- **Freelancing**: Offering services in AI-based works.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:
- While I have not yet contributed to widely recognized open-source projects, I am actively building my GitHub portfolio, showcasing projects such as the To-Do List Application and Random Quote Generator. I plan to contribute more to open-source initiatives in cybersecurity and software development as I expand my skills and experience.

#### History of Community Engagement:
- As a Women in Tech Lead for ThinkerHub and an O-Pen Mike organizer, I regularly mentor students and moderate discussions on technical subjects, like Git and GitHub basics. I also guide students in setting up GitHub repositories and accounts and share valuable resources with my team. Through TEDxSJCETPalai volunteering and other roles, I engage with a broad community interested in technology and innovation.

#### Highly Visible Technical Content:
- Currently, I am preparing tutorials on foundational data structures like stacks, queues, and polynomial addition using Linked Lists. These tutorials include pseudocode, algorithms, and visual representations to help others learn effectively. I plan to post these and future tutorials on platforms like GitHub and potentially my own blog.

#### Highly Used Software Tools:
- I have yet to create widely used tools but am focused on developing practical software for real-world use. My projects are shared on GitHub to help beginners and inspire collaboration, and I plan to expand on these projects to reach more users.

#### Competitive Website Profiles:
- I currently do not have profiles on competitive coding websites like HackerRank or Kaggle but am actively working to expand my presence. I am participating in the Top 100 Coders Challenge, which will help me build a stronger profile in competitive coding.

#### Leadership and Influence:
- In my role as a Women in Tech Lead, I organize and manage technical sessions, share resources, and mentor my team members. I also play a leadership role in organizing community events like O-Pen Mike, where I guide participants through technical setups and ensure they are engaged and supported. These experiences have helped me develop my leadership and influencing skills, especially in managing groups and facilitating learning.

#### Networking:
- Networking is essential to me, and I am excited about connecting with other members of the Top 100 Coders Challenge community. By sharing my knowledge, experiences, and project insights, I hope to create valuable connections and exchange ideas. I also plan to engage actively in discussions on the μLearn Discord community, contributing to a collaborative environment where members can inspire each other.

#### As a Top 100 Member:
- Applying for the Top 100 Coders Challenge aligns perfectly with my professional goals. It will allow me to learn from and engage with other skilled coders, enhancing my technical and networking skills. Being part of this elite group will also open doors to new opportunities and projects that will strengthen my career in cybersecurity and software development.

#### Career Plan:
- I am committed to contributing to Kerala's growing startup ecosystem by working on projects that bridge technology and cybersecurity. My immediate goal is to build practical solutions for social media security and fake account detection. In the longer term, I aim to establish a cybersecurity consultancy that helps startups maintain secure digital infrastructures. I believe Kerala has immense potential in tech, and with more government and private sector support, it can become a leading startup hub.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:
- Kerala’s startup ecosystem has shown significant growth, with supportive government policies and an increasing number of tech hubs. For Kerala to excel further, it needs to prioritize cybersecurity and digital infrastructure. Strengthening collaboration between startups and educational institutions can also bridge the skills gap, empowering students with practical knowledge early on.
