# Sivani L R 

### About Me

Hi, I'm Sivani, a third-year computer science student with a passion for coding and a strong interest in volunteering and participating in various societies. I'm an active member of socities like IEEE, GDSC, and TinkerHub, where I love being part of a community that is dedicated to making a positive impact. Through my involvement, I've gained valuable experience in project management, teamwork, and communication, and I'm always looking for ways to learn and grow. I'm excited to connect with others who share my interests and look forward to exploring potential opportunities for collaboration!


### Portfolio Highlights

- IConnect : A flutter app created as part of Make-A-Ton , it contains the interface of a social media app wherein you can connect with others based on your interest.
- Zone-Ai : An Ai Sentiment Analizer web app, that can make automatically detect the sentiment / mood from your sentences and then make graphs on your mood. 



#### Leadership and Influence: 

- I am currently the GDSC Lead at my college and as part of that I have been able to manage a team on my own as well as bring forth events I have always wanted to see in my college. I am trying to build a more project based coding environment among the gdsc community. I want people to stop falling into the tutorial trap and start building projects as small as they maybe. 

#### Networking: 

- I am always eager to connect with other coders and developers and connect with them. I do beleive that there is a shortage of spaces where we can connect with others as developers and share our ideas and projects. I am always enthusiatic to attend hackathons in hopes of finding an environment like that. I am hoping Top 100 Coders does the same. 


#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: `required field`

- Surely more empasis on project building and internships where we are actually working in a real life environment instead of simply learning things. There are a lot of pay-for-internships in Kerala and outside which I really think is doing the opposite of what it was supposed to do.
