#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- The startup ecosystem in Kerala could support the local people and
  economy, without relying too much on Big Tech monopolies.
- Integrating schools and universities with the industry will allow
  students to get involved from an early stage and specialise where they
  shine the most. In addition, reducing the importance of grades and
  encouraging students to innovate and collaborate with others will go a
  long way in improving the tech ecosystem in Kerala
