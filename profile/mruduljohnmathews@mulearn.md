# Top 100 Finalist -  Proof of Work

#### My Contribution:
I'm Mrudul John Mathews, a dynamic developer in team Reverend. Even though I am a python enthusiast , This time for our project DevFlow , We all had to focus more on extension development. I worked on all the phases of development from ideation till deployment.

#### Key Contributions:
- My primary objective was to simplify and streamline the management of programming environments within Visual Studio Code using OpenAI-powered prompts which was challenging and laid the skelton for the entire extension. But I am happy that I could implement it. This helped to empower users to set up diverse programming environments effortlessly, catering to various languages and frameworks.

#### Challenges Overcome
- I only have one mere hackathon experience in creation of vs code extension. Hence I had to go through thorough documentations and youtube to develop the initial stage. Debugging was one of the most difficult thing I faced. It nearly took around 5hrs of mine to fix the debugger itself which was tiring. Manipulation of typescript also was a new thing to me. But peer support helped in clearing the bugs and proceeding forward in the successfull development of the extension. Also helped in both github and directory automation as well voice translation integration so that we could build something more better.

#### Future Enhancements:
- We worked on the voice to command translation model integration. Except the provision to record voice from the vs code , everything else , we could successfully implement. So we will work on some way to fix that as well. The code is very clean , so more developers can contribute the project make it much more useful to all the developers across the world.
#### Final Thoughts:
- If we have the dedication to work on something , whatever it is ,if you are willing to do it, then you can achieve it. DevFlow is such a result of collaboration, innovation, and a shared passion for making coding accessible to everyone.
