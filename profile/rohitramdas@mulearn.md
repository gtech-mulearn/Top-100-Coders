# Rohit Ramdas V (Backend Developer)

### About Me

> I am a Backend Developer with a strong foundation in Java-based Spring framework, specializing in the creation of RESTful APIs and web backends. Currently in my third year of Computer Science studies, I am driven by a genuine passion for computer science and adept at tackling complex problems.
My proficiency extends to Java Spring, Android development, and adept management of databases including MySQL. I am well-versed in essential tools such as Jira and Docker, and have honed my collaborative skills through active participation in agile teams.

>update : I can now also work decently using react and firebase, also learned how to build discord bots.


### Portfolio Highlights


#### Leadership and Influence: 

- TinkerHub TechLead : TechLead of TinkerHub Toc H , have organised events to help students get started with Technology.
- GDSC Android Dev: Android Dev for GDSC Toc H , contributed to organizing events for skill development as a core team member.Also acted as mentor for Cloud Study Jams 2023 ,GDSC Toc H Chapter
- Hackathon Leadership: Led a 4-member team to secure second place in the competition.

#### Networking: 

- Having an active involvement in multiple communities like TinkerHub and GDSC, I've had the oppurtunity to connect with a wide array of individuals, each having their own perspectives and backgrounds. These interactions have been exceptionally productive for me, as someone passionate about technology.
- As a member of the Top 100 community, I would like to build connections through engaging discussions on technology and exchanging viewpoints. I'm particularly enthusiastic about addressing the prevalent skill gap among students. By collaborating with fellow members, we can collectively devise strategies to bridge this gap.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- On a personal level, this community serves as an invaluable showcase for my skills and expertise. It offers an opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals who share my passion for technology, potentially leading to collaborations in the future. This network promises to open new doors and avenues for me, providing significant benefits to my career .
- Being a part of the Top 100 community would help me form connection with some of the most brilliant minds in Kerala. This is a good opportunity for knowledge exchange and professional growth. It is not only about personal advancement; it is about contributing to the community. As a member, I look forward to offering my skills and expertise to assist my peers while developing myself.

#### Career Plan: 

- In the immediate term , I would like to increase the pool of students interested in tech through workshops , mentorships etc., and help people realise that learning tech is actually fun.
- In the long term,I want to introduce programs that let us learn by doing, through projects and real-world problem-solving. 
This approach would be great for both students, as well as startups as they often can't spend a lot of time on training. So, if we're already skilled up and ready to roll, we can dive right in and help bring innovative ideas to life.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

- Kerala has a really good pool of people and communities interested in Tech. It has the potential to be a leader in Tech Innovation. Improving upon the existing human resource to help bring out unique, innovative and game changing ideas through a collaborative effort between industries , government and students( those looking for a career in tech ) will be key to developing the already existing ecosystem.

#### History of Open Source Contributions:

- Though I have worked in projects both personal and in large scale ones , I currently dont have any contibuitions in opensource public repositories.

#### History of Community Engagement:

-  Most of my community engagment is offline . In case of engagment as a mentor , I have helped mentor students participating in GDSC cloud study jam 2023 under GDSC Toc H , I have also conducted session about using GitHub.


#### Competitive Website Profiles:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/Rohit_Ramdas/)
- [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/profile/rohit_ramdas_v)





#### Updates

- Before joining Top 100 Coders, I was heavily focused on backend development. However, the project submissions pushed me to broaden my horizons and deploy my first full-stack app. Since then, I have gained more experience with front-end frameworks, particularly React.
- The amount of DSA questions we had to do to reach under 20k is a testament to our patience and dedication.

#### Huddle Physical Level Contributions

- This was my first time working with any kind of generative APIs, as I am usually an app builder.
- In our project AutoExcel, I worked on setting up a Discord bot with connectivity to Google Sheets, as well as a backend service using FastAPI.
- I worked with some basic React, which was a departure from my usual work with Java Spring. I also worked with languages, frameworks, and APIs that I had never used before. Overall, this was a great learning experience for me.
- Got to collaborate and talk with many great minds.

># Proof of Work
>### My Contribution:
>
>Hello, I'm Rohit Ramdas, a backend developer. In our project AutoExcel, which aims to make data insertion to sheets more efficient.
>
>### Key Contributions:
>
>1. Built a discord bot which can be used to convert unstructured messages to stuctured json onjects which can be then inserted directly to google sheets.
>2. Used fast api to set up a api layer to access open ai apis.
>### Challenges Overcome:
>
>Every single technology used to build the project was a first for me. From using python for most of the project to using open ai apis and google sheet apis.
>
>### Future Enhancements:
>
>Would like to bring some more features which can help with overall editing of excel sheets rather that just insertion.
gpts ability to give context aware answers would be really helpful here.
>
>### Final Thoughts:
>
>The entire event was a great learning experience which has helped me push my boundaries as a coder.
