#### My Contribution:
- Developer in Team CodeWiz.
- We build these following products:
> Fused CLI & OpenAI for a voice-based OS
> Created an extension that analyze online meetings using OpenAI and answers the questions that we ask
#### Key Contributions:
- Front-end of Voice OS is mainly designed using Tkinter,a standard Python library used for creating GUI applications.
- Front-end of STT AI extension is build using React Js


#### Challenges Overcome
- Varied Browser Versions Challenge:
   -> During our journey, accessing voice data in online meetings posed a significant challenge due to discrepancies in browser versions.
   -> The inconsistency made accessing these data a complex task, requiring a unique solution.

- Innovative Extension Creation:
   -> To resolve the issue, we developed a specialized extension designed as a popup interface.
   -> This inventive solution aimed to streamline access while navigating the complexities of permission management.

- Complexity of Voice OS:
   -> Another hurdle we encountered was the complexity inherent in voice operating systems.
   -> In response, we devised a strategy to enhance user experience by creating a simple, intuitive graphical user interface (GUI).

- User-Centric Approach:
   -> Our focus remained on ensuring user-friendliness and accessibility.
   -> By implementing these solutions, we aimed to empower users to navigate voice technology effortlessly, marking significant milestones in our journey.

#### Future Enhancements:
