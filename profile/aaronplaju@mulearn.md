#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala boasts a wealth of top-tier talent, potentially the best in the country. However, numerous government initiatives, though commendable, often remain obscure and inaccessible to many, leading them towards the conventional seek opportunities abroad for financial gains route. It's imperative that we not only provide these opportunities but also actively disseminate awareness about them, ensuring that we retain the majority, if not all, of the talent nurtured in our state.
