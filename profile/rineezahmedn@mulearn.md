#### Leadership and Influence: 

- I co-founded Livares Technologies Pvt Ltd and have been serving as the CTO of the company for the last 14 years.
- During most of my career I have been responsible for recruiting, training and mentoring the software engineering teams of Livares.

#### Networking: 

- My excellant written & verbal communication skills in English, and Malayalam can help me network smoothly with the rest of the Top 100 community. I can also become a mentor and help people with their challenges.

#### As a Top 100 Member: 

- I hope to improve and sharpen my own coding skills while also contribute back to the coders community by helping others to become better coders and software engineers.
- If I achieve a top 100 rank in this competition, it will definitely improve my individual reputation as a technical leader.
- I hope to get oopportunities to network with most talented coders in my region.
- I also hope this competition can create opportunities for more exposure for my company Livares.

#### Career Plan:

- In immediate term I plan to mentor freshers and Junior Software Engineers from Kerala, to help freshers clear interviews and Junior software engineers to become better engineers. I already try to help/guide people who approach me via LinkedIn.
- My longer-term plan is to form an NGO or a community of passionate and highly knowledgable engineering professionals in tech industry to conduct training sessions in engineering colleges and vocational training institutions in Kerala to help improve quality of fresh graduates coming out from our institutions.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- We must establish early mentorship programs in professional collages and polytechnics of Kerala to ensure fresh graduates are trained on best practices, principles, processes and tools that are widely used in the tech industry so that recruiting managers can hire our fresh graduates more confidently without worrying that the fresh recruits cannot be productive without spending extra time and money for training them, even though they have the talent and technical skills required for the job.
- Form small industry cells inside technical institutions to give students the required infrastructure and guidance to develop softwares or technolgies while they are still doing their graduation study. This program must be designed to give them an opportunity to gain hands-on experience in the potential careers they can pursue after the graduation, so that they can present themselves as experienced candidates immediately after the graduation.
