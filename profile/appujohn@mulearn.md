### About Me

> I am a first-year Electrical and Electronics Engineering student at St. Joseph's College of Engineering and Technology, Palai. Despite my focus on electrical engineering, I recognize the importance of technology in the digital age and am passionate about expanding my skills in backend software development. I have an intermediate understanding of coding, development, and hosting, with a primary focus on Python, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, I have experience working with databases, including MongoDB, Redis, and Firebase.



As I continue my journey, I aim to bridge the gap between electrical engineering and computer science, leveraging my coding skills to contribute to innovative solutions in both fields.
