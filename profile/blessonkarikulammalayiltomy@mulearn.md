#### Leadership and Influence:

- I am currently serving in the Student Leadership team of IEEE Communications Society Kerala Chapter.
- I was the Head of Department for Student Council, serving in the Executive Committee as a planner and program initiater in my 11th and 12th grade in Catholic Junior College, Singapore.
- I was elected as the 46th Student Council Vice-President by the student population in a school-wide vote in 9th grade in Montfort Secondary School, Singapore.

#### Networking:

- Having been in Kerala for 1.5 years now, I understand that students need motivation and guidance to go above and beyond what they are required to do. Therefore, I hope to bring about this change with the various initiatives that we can put forward. 

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- As an aspiring software developer, being in the top 100 will help me become recognised among my peers for my abilites as a leader and a programmer. I will be able to show this as a portfolio to my potential recruiters in the future.
- Furthermore, I will be able to encourage my peers to work beyond the college curriculum and become active in the coding and open source community.

#### Career Plan:

- I think the first step would be to address the knowledge gap. Show students that there are successful companies that began as a startup from college. This example, in addition to guidance and mentoring, will definitely ignite the entrepreneurship fire in our students and help them to strive to be their own boss.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- The first step would be to decrease the focus on theoretical knowledge and increase the practical applications. While many students are capable of programming well, they are held back by the strains of a theoretical education system. This must change. Colleges can bring about modules/subjects with more application rather than theory so that students talented in problem solving and programming can develop themselves and grow.
