### portfolio highlights


#### history of open source contributions:

- made a discord bot which pushes streamer notifications from a livestreaming platform named loco.gg to discord servers. they had no public api (i asked them but there were no replies) so i had to webscrape the profile of each streamer.
- worked on the exam hall seat allocator owned by govind s b in its initial days.

#### history of community engagement:

-  answered questions on discord bot creation on a discord server owned by the youtuber lucas

#### highly visible technical content:

- had close to 10 discord bots running before the ban on the game, which were scraped almost a year ago.
- made a [webscrapper](https://github.com/tsuAquila/Hacker-News-Webscrap) for hackernews 

#### highly used software tools:

- part of the dev team of the "easy manager" discord bot by akef (all kerala esports federation), used to organize esports tournaments.
- ehe exam hall seat allocator is currently being used by our college for series examinations.

#### competitive website profiles:

- [hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/profile/reenacottage): gotta get in the top 500k ranks
- [exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/tsuAquila): recently started to learn c++
- [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/reenacottage/): used ages ago
- [codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/tsuaquila): idk. govind made me start an account

#### leadership and influence:

- i was kinda popular among the pubg mobile lite gaming community of kerala as admin of various organizations ([aura](https://www.instagram.com/aurapubgml/), [mef](https://www.instagram.com/mef.official_/), [dna](https://www.instagram.com/d.n.a_esports/)), conducted tournaments and had developed discord bots for teams.

#### Networking:

- i believe i perform well in one-on-one conversations rather than group discussions. so i can really use that to my advantage to improve connections with people of various backgrounds and skill sets.

#### as a top 100 member:

- introduced to this by my friends who are part of the mulearn core team, and i thought since it uses hackerrank, which is primarily used to practice competitive coding, i could give it a try
- (also, this was a way to farm karma points. teehee).

#### career plan:

- ok. this might sound really weird. i'm planning to go for a govt job.

#### thoughts on kerala's tech ecosystem:

- not really familiar with how the upper brackets are, but as a student, i can say that the situation in tier 3 colleges like mine is grim. there is little to no support to improve skill sets. The sole focus is on attendance and pass percentage.
