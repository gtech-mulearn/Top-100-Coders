#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem:

- Kerala had witnessed a surge in startup activity. The state government had set up several incubators and accelerators to support startups. One prominent one was the Kerala Startup Mission
- Despite the progress, Kerala faced challenges, such as the need for greater infrastructural development, stronger networking opportunities, and more support for early-stage startups.
- While Kerala is not as prominent as tech hubs like Bangalore or Hyderabad, we will gradually gain traction in terms of attracting venture capital and investments.
- With proper mentoring and support the brilliant minds in Kerala can turn the tide.
