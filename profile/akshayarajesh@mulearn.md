### About Me

> The journey so far has been all about connecting dots, embracing technology, and championing local solutions for the challenges we face. 
From working closely with local government bodies to bridging the gap between academia and industry, I've always believed in the power of community and innovation.


### Portfolio Highlights



#### Leadership and Influence:

- I took the lead on the 'One Local Government One Idea' initiative right here in Kerala. It was all about encouraging local bodies to think out of the box and come up with innovative solutions.
- At GTech Mulearn, I wore the hat of a Program Manager. There, I was all about creating a space where knowledge flowed freely between academia, industry, government, and our communities.
- Representing the Trivandrum Chapter as a Global Ambassador for Singularity University was another feather in my cap. It was a fantastic experience, emphasizing the importance of technologies that can change the world.

#### Networking:

- Being a part of the Top 100 community is my next goal. I believe in the power of collaboration, and I'm excited to share, learn, and inspire.

#### As a Top 100 Member:

- After college, I took a detour from the tech world and it's been years since I last coded. 
The Top 100 feels like the perfect place to reignite that spark, dive back into the tech scene, and connect with like-minded individuals. 
It's more than just joining a group; it's about restarting my tech journey and truly making an impact.

#### Career Plan: 

- Right now, my focus is on integrating the latest tech trends into Kerala's innovation landscape. 
But looking ahead, I dream of a Kerala that's a global name in the tech startup world. And I'm all in to make that dream come true.

#### Thoughts on Kerala's Tech Ecosystem: 

- Kerala's got potential, loads of it. We have the talent, the drive, and the passion. 
It's all about fostering collaborations, encouraging young talent, and making Kerala the place to be for tech startups.

#### History of Community Engagement:

Throughout my journey, community has always been at the heart of what I do. 
- At GTech Mulearn, I was deeply involved in fostering a vibrant community and ensuring a seamless flow of knowledge between companies, colleges, and students.
- My role at KDISC further solidified my commitment to community-driven innovation
- As a Global Ambassador for Singularity University, I had the privilege of rallying communities around the transformative power of exponential technologies.
